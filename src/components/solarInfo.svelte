  <h3>Birth of the Solar System</h3>
  <p>
    Our solar system began as part of a massive nebula cloud of molecular
    hydrogen and dust around 4.6 billion years ago. In a region of this dark
    cloud conditions allowed gravity to begin condensing the hydrogen until a
    substantial mass began to grow ever larger and hotter, eventually this mass
    collapsed in on itself, forming the early stage of a star called a
    protostar. The gravitational pull of the embryonic star caused a large disc
    of gas and dust to begin forming around it.

  <p>
    Over millions of years pressure began to build up inside the protostar as it
    became hotter and denser until eventually nuclear fusion began in its core,
    giving birth to the sun as we know it. During this time the disc of gas and
    dust that had formed around the star had also began condensing into ever
    growing orbiting bodies. In time they would go on to form the planets, moons
    and other objects in our solar system.
