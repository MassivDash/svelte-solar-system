    <h3>Birth of the Solar System</h3>
    <p>
      Our solar system began as part of a massive nebula cloud of molecular
      hydrogen and dust around 4.6 billion years ago. In a region of this dark
      cloud conditions allowed gravity to begin condensing the hydrogen until a
      substantial mass began to grow ever larger and hotter, eventually this
      mass collapsed in on itself, forming the early stage of a star called a
      protostar. The gravitational pull of the embryonic star caused a large
      disc of gas and dust to begin forming around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over millions of years pressure began to build up inside the protostar as
      it became hotter and denser until eventually nuclear fusion began in its
      core, giving birth to the sun as we know it. During this time the disc of
      gas and dust that had formed around the star had also began condensing
      into ever growing orbiting bodies. In time they would go on to form the
      planets, moons and other objects in our solar system.

    <h3>Planets of the Solar System</h3>
    <p>
      The nearest planet to the sun is Mercury, aptly named after the swift
      footed messenger god it orbits the sun in only 88 days, quicker than any
      other planet in the solar system. Next comes Venus, often referred to as
      Earthâ€™s sister planet but underneath her thick clouds lies a hellish oven
      baked landscape with temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Third planet
      from the sun lies Earth, a striking blue sphere covered with oceans of
      liquid water and the only planet known to us which harbors life. The last
      of the rocky inner planets is Mars, consisting of a thin atmosphere this
      red body was once covered in oceans just like Earth but is now a desert
      where dust storms can engulf the entire planet.
